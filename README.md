# Panoramic-360-view

## About
This project focuses on integrating 360° panoramic images captured from the field into QGIS, enabling users to:

🖼️ View panoramic imagery directly within QGIS.

✏️ Interactively update and manage spatial information linked to each image.

🔄 Seamlessly connect visual field data with geospatial features for enhanced analysis and decision-making.

The goal is to bridge the gap between field-collected visuals and GIS-based workflows, improving situational awareness and data accuracy.
